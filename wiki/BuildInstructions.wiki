1) Compile all subprojects.  Not sure how to get XCode to do this for me.

2) Compile main project.

2.5) Check build output.  If PackageMaker (last build step) said "Error: source not on disk" or something like that, the build didn't work and logKext.pkg won't exist.  In this case, you need to just run the build again and it should work.

3) Install logKext.pkg.
